# CS224N
project for CS224N NLP with Deep Learning



Part of the code for supervised-fine-tuning and dpo was adapted and inspired from a deeplearning.ai notebook, "Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of an LLM" and "Human preference fine-tuning using direct preference optimization (DPO) of an LLM" by Lewis Tunstall and Edward Beeching of Hugging Face.
