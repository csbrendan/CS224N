He is end stage liver failure, but dosn't meet the guidelines for a liver transplant due to a colon cancer diagnosis in 2012.  The colon cancer was successfully treated with colon resection. We were told by a previous physician that there is an approved drug which \"cures\" hep b.  He emphasized that the new drug is a cure, not a treatment.  I tried to find infoon my own, to no avail.  I contacted NIH and was told to call the FDA.  I have had no response from the FDA re: messages left in 2013.  Their website was futile. Can you assist us.  My family member is end stage and if this physician was accurate, this could assist us tremendously.  He is taking baracluse and  xifacxin as well as lactulose.  His primary care physician is alarmingly unknowledgable.",
    "predicted_answer": "I'm sorry to hear about your family member's condition. I can understand why you are looking for a cure for hepatitis B. However, I must clarify that there is no approved drug that cures hepatitis B. The only approved treatment for hepatitis B is a vaccine. However, there are several antiviral agents that can help control the infection and reduce the risk of liver damage and liver cancer. These include nucleos(t)ide analogues such as lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, and tenofovir. These drugs can help reduce the viral load and suppress the virus for a long time. In addition, there are several other antiviral agents that are undergoing clinical trials. It is important to note that these drugs can only help control the infection and do not cure the disease. Therefore, it is important to continue to take the medication as directed by your doctor. If you have any further questions, please let me know.",

Letrozole is a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor that was first approved by the FDA in 2002. It is commonly used to treat postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive early breast cancer. It works by blocking the aromatase enzyme, which is responsible for converting androgens to estrogens. This can help to reduce the amount of estrogen in the body, which can promote the growth of breast cancer cells. Letrozole is typically given to women who have undergone surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy as an adjuvant therapy to help reduce the risk of recurrence.

It is often prescribed for short-term weight loss in combination with a diet and exercise program. Phentermine works by affecting the central nervous system to reduce appetite. In addition to weight loss, Phentermine can also be used to treat other conditions. Phentermine can be used off-label to treat other conditions such as chronic pain, migraines, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

    "predicted_answer": "Hi! I'm sorry to hear that. Diaphragmatic hernia is a rare congenital malformation that occurs in 1 in 2500 live births. It is caused by a defect in the diaphragm that allows abdominal organs to move into the chest cavity. Diaphragmatic hernia can be diagnosed in the first or second trimester of pregnancy by ultrasound. If a fetus is diagnosed with diaphragmatic hernia, the mother may be recommended to terminate the pregnancy or continue the pregnancy under the care of a specialist. If the mother chooses to continue the pregnancy, the baby will need to be delivered by cesarean section and will require immediate medical attention. The baby will likely need oxygen therapy and may require surgery to repair the diaphragm. The prognosis for babies with diaphragmatic hernia depends on the size of the hernia and the extent of lung involvement. Babies with large hernias and significant lung involvement have a poor prognosis, while babies with small hernias and minimal lung involvement have a good prognosis.

    "question": "SUBJECT: ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information\nMESSAGE: Dear Team,\nIn 1996, I had an accident on my left eye when a ball smashed it.\nRetina fallen down, lens damaged. I hadn't been operated at that point only later, in 2003 when the pressure was very high (above 30 mp). This first operation had fixed the retina with endolaser, removed vitreous body filled with silicone oil, replaced the lens with an artificial one and stabilized the pressure to around 15-10 mp. However, the eye got blood, retina got detached and it had to be operated again. This time, the oil replaced with gas.\nAfter 2 years, another attempt made with oil and lastly with gas, but the retina fallen again and again.\nCurrently, the retina is still detached, the pressure is low (max 4 mp), has often blood around the iris and it hurts a bit when the air pressure changes. I cannot see anything with it apart from blur lights. The doctor says, this damaged eye is shrinking continuously.\nMy other eye functioning well. I learned to live together with it, however, the doctor says, he strongly recommends enucleation. I dont know if there is any other option to avoid enucleation.\nI have 2 young children so if there were any option to avoid enucleatio, I would happy travel/pay for that.\nKindly let me know if there is any other option. My main priority -if available- would be to live with my own or another organic eye which doesn't look scary even if it is not functional.\nSecond priority is to have usable organic eye- but my doctor told, this is not yet possible.

It is caused by a mutation in one of the mismatch repair genes, including MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. Transposable elements are mobile genetic elements that can move from one location to another in the genome. They can be divided into two main classes: Class I retrotransposons, which include long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons and non-LTR retrotransposons, and Class II DNA transposons. LTR retrotransposons are the largest class of transposable elements in the human genome, accounting for approximately 8% of the genome. They are divided into three main groups: endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), which are the result of the integration of exogenous retroviruses into the germline of early primates, long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1), and short interspersed nuclear element (SINE). Non-LTR retrotransposons are divided into two main groups:",

I splinted it myself with a store-bought splint because of concern for a break as well as ligament damage.  I just went to see an orthopedic doctor for the first time today (yes, I'm kicking myself for not going earlier).  The X-ray showed that the finger is still offset somewhat, perhaps indicating that some of the ligaments were ruptured. (The bone was ok.  I guess we won't know if it was ever broken.)  Nonetheless, I have to see a surgeon for an opinion in a few days.  Meanwhile, there is still some swelling and the ring finger that was in the splint is out but stiff as a board.  I'm concerned and not sure what possibilities to expect.  I certainly know you won't know what the situation is or what the surgeon will say but I was curious (a) what possibilities I might expect and (b) how problematic it is that the finger is so stiff...should I expect to regain motion...can it be rehabbed?

    "predicted_answer": "I'm sorry to hear that. Fibroid tumors are the most common benign tumor of the uterus. They are noncancerous growths of smooth muscle tissue that develop in the uterus. They are also known as leiomyomas. It is unclear what is causing the fibroid tumors on your spinal column, but there are several possible causes. One possibility is that the fibroid tumors are a result of the hysterectomy. Hysterectomy can cause changes in the uterus that can lead to the development of fibroid tumors. Another possibility is that the fibroid tumors are a result of hormonal changes. Fibroid tumors are often associated with hormonal changes, such as those that occur during pregnancy or menopause. It is also possible that the fibroid tumors are a result of genetic factors. Some studies have suggested that certain genes may be associated with an increased risk of developing fibroid tumors. If you have any of these risk factors, it is important to talk to your doctor about your concerns and to get regular check-ups.",

I was wondering if you could tell me about the risks that come with genetically engineered food and how the modification is actually conducted.",
    "predicted_answer": "I'd be happy to help! Genetically engineered (GE) food is food that has been altered in a laboratory using genetic engineering techniques. These techniques involve the insertion of new genetic material into the DNA of a food source, typically a plant or animal. This new genetic material is usually inserted to give the food specific traits, such as resistance to pests or herbicides. There is currently no scientific evidence to suggest that GE food is harmful to humans or the environment. However, there are some concerns about the potential for GE food to spread to other plants, which could have unintended consequences. It is also important to note that the majority of GE food on the market is produced using traditional breeding techniques, which are similar to the natural processes that occur in nature. Overall, the benefits of GE food outweigh the potential risks, and it is considered safe for human consumption.",

It is a lipophilic drug, which means that it is easily absorbed by the body and can be stored in fatty tissues. The drug is metabolized in the liver and excreted in the feces and urine. The half-life of isotretinoin is approximately 20 hours, which means that it can be detected in the body for up to a month after it is taken. The build-up of isotretinoin in the body can be influenced by several factors, including the dose of the drug, the length of treatment, and the patient's age, weight, and liver function. The structure of isotretinoin is thought to contribute to its build-up in the body, as it is a highly lipophilic drug with a low water solubility.",

    "question": "Hi All,\nI am from India and really worried.\nI have a 6 months old baby girl. I have read the article on Lactose intolerance. She is unable to digest any formula milk or any milk products. When she was a new born, I started giving her Lactogen (a formula milk) a little bit along with my milk. She was fine with it but after 3 weeks, I switched her to another formula milk named Nan Pro 0 which is for babies upto 1 year. She started drinking that along with my breast milk. After 2 weeks, she started getting Diarrhea and a severe one where she pooped at least 15 times in one day. Therefore, I consulted the doctor and the doctor immediately asked me to put her on breast milk only. I did try that but she was hungry and crying therefore, I gave her a little bit of formula milk aswell. She was file with all the medicines. However, once the medicine stooped, she again started getting diarrhea. This continued on and off.\nAfter a while, the doctor asked me to stop the formula milk and start giving her Zerolac (soy milk) along with breast feeding. I did that and everything smoothened. However, after 2 months, I asked my doctor if we can start giving her any type of milk apart from zerolac as I was concerned about her getting calcium in her body with having milk. The doctor asked me to give her formula milk (Nan Pro 0). I did that but just after half an hour, she suddenly started vomiting which continued till she had the milk in her stomach. Once that stopped, she started getting diarrhea which continued till 3 days. She was put back on Zerolac again and breast milk.\nAs she is now 6 months old, I thought of giving Cerelac to her but again she did not digest it and went through the same problem again. I am unable to find the right doctor here in India where I live.\nPlease help my daughter in this situation. Please let me know the contact detail may be an email address of any doctor with whom I can discuss my case. Please help us.\nThanks for all your help.\nRegards,\n[cid:",

However, there are ways to reduce this risk. One option is to consider prenatal genetic testing, which can be done through amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. These tests can be done between 10 and 13 weeks of pregnancy and can help identify whether the fetus has inherited the genetic mutation associated with myasthenia gravis. If the fetus has inherited the mutation, there may be other options available to you, such as terminating the pregnancy or choosing to deliver via cesarean section.

    "predicted_answer": "Hello! Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by recurrent attacks of fever and serositis. The attacks of fever usually last for 1-2 days and are accompanied by chills, headache, arthralgia, and fatigue. During the attacks, the patients may have abdominal pain, chest pain, and/or arthritis. The attacks of serositis usually involve the peritoneum and pleura, and less commonly the pericardium. The attacks of serositis are usually self-limited and resolve spontaneously. The attacks of fever and serositis are usually separated by symptom-free intervals that vary in length from months to years. FMF is caused by mutations in the MEFV gene, which encodes the protein pyrin. The pyrin protein is involved in the regulation of inflammation and the production of interleukin-1 (IL-1). The mutations in the MEFV gene are thought to cause a hyperactive inflammatory response, leading to the symptoms of FMF. The diagnosis of FMF is based on the presence of recurrent attacks",

    "predicted_answer": "I found several articles that discuss treatment options for pubic lice. According to the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom, the most effective treatment for pubic lice is a 1% permethrin lotion or cream. The NHS recommends applying the lotion or cream to the affected area and leaving it on for 10 minutes before washing it off with soap and water. If the lice persist after two treatments, the NHS suggests using a 4% lotion or cream containing linolenic acid. It is important to note that these treatments may cause skin irritation, so it is recommended to use a barrier cream, such as petroleum jelly or vaseline, to protect the skin around the affected area.",

    "predicted_answer": "I'm sorry to hear that you have been worried about this issue for a long time.  I can see why it would be a concern, but it's good to know that it is very rare for a foreign object to perforate the digestive tract and not be noticed.  If a foreign object does perforate the digestive tract, the body will usually try to wall off the object and encapsulate it.  Over time, the body will try to eliminate the object through the feces.  If the object is not eliminated, it may be possible for the body to eliminate it through the skin or mucosa of the affected area.  This is known as autotomy.  If the object is not eliminated through the skin or mucosa, it may be possible for the body to eliminate it through a surgical procedure.  It is important to note that the body will try to eliminate the object as soon as possible, so it is unlikely for a foreign object to remain in the digestive tract for an extended period of time.  If you are concerned about this issue, it may be helpful to speak with a doctor or a gastroenterologist.  They may be able to provide you with more information and advice",

Albinism is a group of genetic disorders characterized by partial or complete lack of pigment in the skin, hair, and eyes. It is caused by mutations in genes that are involved in the production of melanin, the pigment that gives color to the skin, hair, and eyes. There are several types of albinism, which are classified based on which gene is affected. The three main types are oculocutaneous albinism (OCA), which affects the skin, hair, and eyes; ocular albinism (OA), which affects the eyes only; and congenital central hypomelanosis (CCH), which affects the skin only. OCA is the most common type of albinism and is caused by mutations in the genes TYR, OCA2, and Pmel17. OA is caused by mutations in the gene TYRP1. CCH is not caused by mutations in any known genes.

Gilbert's syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the metabolism of the body. It is caused by a defect in the gene that codes for an enzyme called UGT1A1, which is responsible for breaking down bilirubin. Bilirubin is a waste product of red blood cell breakdown, and it is normally excreted by the liver. In people with Gilbert's syndrome, the liver is unable to break down bilirubin effectively, so it builds up in the blood. This can cause the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes to turn yellow, which is called jaundice. Gilbert's syndrome is usually harmless and does not require treatment. However, in rare cases, it can cause serious complications such as liver failure or pancreatitis. If you are concerned about your health, I would recommend talking to a doctor or other healthcare professional. They can evaluate your symptoms and recommend appropriate treatment if necessary.",
