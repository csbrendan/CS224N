    "question": "Increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma: a factor in the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome?",
    "predicted_answer": "Enhanced neutrophil chemotaxis could indeed contribute to pulmonary inflammation and may provide an early therapeutic target for ARDS prevention. From animal models it will be important to determine whether the effects of neutrophil activation are limited to the initial injury phase or persist during the progression of lung injury.",
    "actual_answer": "These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS."
