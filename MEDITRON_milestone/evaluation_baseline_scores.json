        "Question": "Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death?",
        "Generated Long Answer": "\nThe lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) is a perennial aquatic plant that grows in the Madagascar region. The leaves of the plant are characterized by a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants. The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells.\n\n### Question: Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death?\n\n### Detailed Answer:\nThe lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) is a perennial aquatic plant that grows in the Madagascar region.

        "Actual Long Answer": "Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.",

It is characterized by the appearance of wheals and angioedema after contact with water. The first case was described in 1966 by . The disease is rare and has been reported in only 100 patients. The incidence is unknown. The disease is more frequent in women than in men (sex ratio 2.5:1). The age of onset is variable, but the disease is most often diagnosed in the second decade of life. The disease is often associated with dermographism, but the latter is not systematic. The disease is often associated with other forms of physical urticaria (cold, heat, pressure, vibration, exercise, etc.). The disease is often associated with other forms of physical urticaria (cold, heat, pressure, vibration, exercise, etc.).\n\n### Pathophysiology\nThe pathophysiology of aquagenic urticaria is not well understood. The disease is probably due to a dysfunction of the skin barrier. The skin barrier is composed of the epidermis, the dermis, the subcutaneous tissue and the mucous membranes. The epidermis is the first barrier against the external environment. It is composed of keratinocytes, melanocytes, Langerhans cells, Merkel cells and fibroblasts. The dermis is composed of collagen, elastic fibers, fibroblasts, nerve endings, blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. The subcutaneous tissue is composed of adipose tissue, fibroblasts, nerve endings, blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. The mucous membranes are composed of epithelial cells, fibroblasts, nerve endings, blood vessels and lymphatic vessels.

The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of EUS fellowships on emergency medicine (EM) residents' US education. We conducted a cross-sectional study at 9 academic medical centers. A questionnaire on US education and bedside US use was pilot tested and given to EM residents. The primary outcomes included the number of US examinations performed, scope of bedside US applications, barriers to residents' US education, and US use in the emergency department. The secondary outcomes were factors that would impact residents' US education. The outcomes were compared between residency programs with and without EUS fellowships. A total of 244 EM residents participated in this study. Thirty percent (95% confidence interval, 24%-35%) reported they had performed more than 150 scans. Residents in programs with EUS fellowships reported performing more scans than those in programs without fellowships (P = .04).

The answer will depend on the type of amblyopia, the age of the patient, the severity of the amblyopia, the age at which the amblyopia was detected and the age at which treatment was commenced.\nThe answer will also depend on the type of treatment that is used.\n\n### Type of amblyopia\nThe type of amblyopia is important. Amblyopia can be classified as either anisometropic, strabismic or mixed.\nAnisometropic amblyopia is caused by a difference in the refractive error between the two eyes. The difference in refractive error is usually between +1.00 and +2.00 dioptres. The amblyopia is usually mild and the visual acuity in the amblyopic eye is usually 6/12 or better.\nStrabismic amblyopia is caused by a misalignment of the eyes. The misalignment can be either a constant or intermittent squint. The amblyopia is usually severe and the visual acuity in the amblyopic eye is usually 6/18 or worse.\nMixed amblyopia is caused by a combination of anisometropia and strabismus.\n\n### Age of the patient\nThe age of the patient is important. The younger the patient the more likely the amblyopia is to be severe. The younger the patient the more likely the amblyopia is to be associated with a significant refractive error.\n\n### Severity of the amblyopia\nThe severity of the amblyopia is important. The more severe the amblyopia the less likely the amblyopia is to improve.\n\n### Age at which the amblyopia was detected\nThe age at which the amblyopia was detected is important. The earlier the amblyopia is detected the more likely the amblyopia is to improve.\n\n### Age at which treatment was commenced\nThe age at which treatment was commenced is important.

        "Question": "Is the Hawkins sign able to predict necrosis in fractures of the neck of the astragalus?",
        "Generated Long Answer": "\nThe Hawkins sign is a clinical sign that can be used to predict the development of avascular necrosis in fractures of the neck of the astragalus. It is based on the observation of the presence or absence of pain in the ankle when the patient is asked to perform a plantar flexion of the ankle. The presence of pain in the ankle is indicative of the development of avascular necrosis. The Hawkins sign is a simple and inexpensive test that can be performed in the emergency room. It is important to note that the Hawkins sign is not a substitute for radiographic evaluation, which is still the gold standard for diagnosing avascular necrosis. However, the Hawkins sign can be a useful tool for identifying patients who are at risk for developing avascular necrosis and who may benefit from early intervention.\n### Discussion:\nThe Hawkins sign is a simple and inexpensive test that can be performed in the emergency room.

The study is limited by its retrospective nature and heterogeneous radiotherapy regimes among radiotherapy patients. The study also did not include a control group of patients who did not receive radiotherapy for their primary rectal cancer.\nThe study found that patients who received radiotherapy for their primary rectal cancer required more radical exenterations, had lower rates of clear resection margins, had increased rates of surgical complications per patient, and had a lower disease-free survival. Overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with clear margins were also lower in the primary irradiated patients.

        "Generated Long Answer": "\nThe answer to the question is \"yes\" because the global management of colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases (CM) at the same centre improves results.\n\n### Discussion:\nThe study by   Synchronous liver metastases from colorectal cancer: global management at the same centre..., Adam   is a retrospective study of 111 patients with synchronous liver metastases (SLM) from colorectal cancer (CRC) who underwent resection of the primary tumour and liver metastases between 2000 and 2006. The study was carried out in two centres, one of which was a specialised centre for liver surgery. The patients were divided into two groups: 45 patients were treated by global management (GM) at the same centre, and 66 patients were treated by separate management (SM) at different centres. The two groups were similar in terms of the characteristics of the primary tumour and liver metastases. The GM group had a higher proportion of patients who underwent chemotherapy prior to liver surgery (92% vs. 38%, P < 0.0001) and a longer delay between the two procedures (212 vs. 182 days, P = 0.04). The first step of liver surgery was more often performed during colorectal surgery in the GM group (62 vs. 6% for SM, P < 0.0001). The number of procedures (CRC+SLM) was lower in the GM group (1.6 vs. 2.3, P = 0.003). The 3-month mortality was 3% for GM and 0% for SM (n.s.). The overall survival rates were 67% and 51% for SM and GM at 3 years (n.s.), and 35 and 31% at 5 years (n.s.). The disease-free survival rates were 14% and 11% at 5 years (P = 0.009).\n\n### Comment:\nThe study by   Synchronous liver metastases from colore",
        "Actual Long Answer": "GM of CRC and SLM was associated with fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher disease-free survival after SLM resection.",
